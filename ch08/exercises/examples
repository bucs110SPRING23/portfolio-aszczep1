## controller - like a nodel, lable for how a class is used 

# model - data 
# view - display (pygame) 


class Controller: 

    def __init__(self):

# sprites - anything that moves and interacts on screen 
# inheritance - if you have a class you can import another one into it 

# sprites must be self.image - instance variable, must be a Surface object 

# if you want to move something across the screen, use getRect and add one constantly
