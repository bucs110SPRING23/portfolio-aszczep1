# managing complexity- advanced programing just manages complexity 
# unix - was the first "good" operating system - was about 1000 SLOC (source lines of code) 
# Chrome - 10000000 SLOC
# OS X - 100,000,000 SLOC 

# Complex objects 
# - primitives: int, str, float, lists, dict, tuple 
# - complex: Turtle: x, y, heading, color(color), pensize(int), shape(str)
# bundle data and functions together 
# - state: the current value of the data() in the object 
# - behavior: the functions that operate on the data in the object 

# Point
# - object should do one thing 
# state: x, y, and color 
# behavior: change_color, move
# Classes == Type 
import turtle
print(type(turtle.Turtle())) # this will be a type of turtle object (complex)

# class are blueprint for objects 
# - functions are stored algorithms 
# - class asa a stored data type 
# - classes are not executable 
# - don't put executable code in global scope, definitions are fine

# Point class 
# - instance: an object created from a specific class 
# - t = turtle.Turtle() # t is an instance of Turtle 
# - instance variable: an internal variable that is part of an instance 
#   - t.x, t.pos # x and pos are instance variables 
# - interface: the functions and variables of an object 
# - t.forward() is pare of the interface in turtle 


# Point - make it a class ourselves
